`PIEC` is an open-source Python library that provides infrastructure for laboratory experiment design and operation through a standardized, hierarchical, object-oriented framework. Originally developed at Brown University as a fork of the ferroelectric testing-focused [EKPY](https://github.com/ElPsyKurisu/ekpmeasure) Python suite, `PIEC` is designed to be extended to any experimental domain that requires programmable instrument control.

## Installation

`PIEC` requires python 3.9 or higher. To install `PIEC`, run the following command in the terminal:

```bash
pip install piec
```

After this, decide whether you would like to run a specific measurment with a GUI or notebook (in which case you'll need to download the appropriate files from the `Measurements` folder). Otherwise, see below for information on how to start scripting. Depending on your instruments, you may also need:

| Requirement | When needed | Download |
|---|---|---|
| **NI-488.2** | GPIB instruments | [ni.com](https://www.ni.com/en/support/downloads/drivers/download.ni-488-2.html) |
| **NI-VISA** | USB-TMC / Ethernet / GPIB via NI-VISA | [ni.com](https://www.ni.com/en/support/downloads/drivers/download.ni-visa.html) |
| **MCC Universal Library + `mcculw`** | Digilent/MCC DAQ boards | [mccdaq.com](http://www.mccdaq.com/swdownload) |

## Overview

Instrument drivers in `PIEC` follow a **type-first** architecture with three layers of abstraction:

| Layer | Role | Examples |
|---|---|---|
| **Level 1 — Instrument** | Base connection management and parameter validation (wraps PyVISA) | `Instrument`, `Scpi` |
| **Level 2 — Category** | Defines required methods and parameter standards for each instrument type | `Awg`, `Oscilloscope`, `Lockin`, `Sourcemeter` |
| **Level 3 — Model** | Implements hardware-specific logic for a particular instrument | `Keysight81150a`, `RigolDS1000Z`, `Keithley2400` |

Measurement code targets the **Level 2 interface**, so instruments are interchangeable without code changes. Each category also provides a **Virtual Instrument** that returns simulated responses, enabling development and testing without physical hardware.

On top of this driver layer, **Measurement classes** coordinate multiple instruments to execute complete experiment protocols — configuring waveforms, triggering acquisition, processing data, and saving results — in a single method call. Pre-built **GUIs** and **Jupyter notebooks** are also provided for routine tasks.

---

## Quick Start

**Virtual hysteresis loop** — no hardware required:

```python
from piec.drivers.awg.k_81150a import Keysight81150a
from piec.drivers.oscilloscope.k_dsox3024a import KeysightDSOX3024a
from piec.measurement.discrete_waveform import HysteresisLoop

awg = Keysight81150a("VIRTUAL")
osc = KeysightDSOX3024a("VIRTUAL")
experiment = HysteresisLoop(awg, osc, save_dir='.')
experiment.run_experiment()  # configures, captures, saves, and analyzes
```

The exact `"VIRTUAL"` address selects the category's virtual implementation while
preserving each model's capability attributes. You can also instantiate
`VirtualAwg` and `VirtualScope` directly for generic category capabilities.

Pass physical addresses instead (or use `autodetect`) and the same code runs on hardware:

```python
from piec.drivers.autodetect import autodetect

awg   = autodetect('awg')
scope = autodetect('scope')
```

For a complete walkthrough, see the [User Guide](https://piec.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user_guide/the_driver.html).

## Contributing

New drivers can be added by implementing a driver subclass alongside its Virtual Instrument, following the [Driver Development Guide](https://github.com/TransluSci/piec/blob/master/src/piec/drivers/example/DRIVER_DEVELOPMENT_GUIDE.md). New experiment types require implementing a Measurement subclass without modifying existing code.

For general guidelines, see the [Contributing Guide](https://piec.readthedocs.io/en/latest/contributing/index.html).
