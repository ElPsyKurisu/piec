The working tree for the outline of PIEC (beta version)

1. Instrument
2. Generator // Measurer (name WIP) // Other (stepper_motor, need a better name for this like indirect, bystander, secondary)
3. AWG, RF_source, Pulser, Source_meter // Oscilloscope, Lockin, DAQ // Stepper_motor
4. Individual models


Note this is different than before:
1. Instrument
2. SCPI_instrument // Arduino // Digilent
3. generic instruments
4. specific instruments


NOTE: For file ordering would be nice to have it with depth, not all files in the same directory -> basically use folders and each level correspnds to the working tree level
