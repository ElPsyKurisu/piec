"""
This is an example template for creating a new instrument driver.
It explains the purpose of each key component required for the autodetect system to work.
"""

# --- 1. IMPORT STATEMENTS ---
# Import the base classes that your driver will inherit from.
# - The first import should be the generic instrument type (e.g., Awg, Oscilloscope).
# - The second import should be the communication protocol class (e.g., Scpi).
# Using relative imports (like . and ..) is standard practice within a package.

from .example import Example
from ..scpi import Scpi #in the case that the instrument is SCPI based, includes all base SCPI commands

"""
below is shown an example of an awg, like the 81150a from Keysight

# The class name should be descriptive and unique.
# It must inherit from the appropriate base classes imported above.
class AnnotatedAwgDriver(Example, Scpi):
    """
    This is the main docstring for your driver.
    Explain what the instrument is and any key details about the driver's implementation.

    # --- 3. AUTODETECT IDENTIFIER ---
    # This is the most important attribute for the autodetect system.
    # The `autodetect_instrument` function will look for this class attribute.
    # It must contain a unique string (or list of strings) that is present
    # in the instrument's response to the '*IDN?' query.

    # Option A: For a driver that controls a single instrument model.

    # The autodetect system is smart enough to handle a list of strings.

    # --- 4. INSTRUMENT PARAMETERS (Optional but Recommended) ---
    # It is good practice to define the known limits and capabilities of the
    # instrument as class attributes. This provides a quick reference and can
    # be used for input validation.

    # --- 5. INITIALIZATION METHOD ---
    # The __init__ method is what gets called when a connection is successful.
    # For SCPI instruments, it's standard to call the parent class's __init__
    # which handles the VISA connection setup.

    # These are the methods that implement the instrument's specific commands.
    # They should use the `self.instrument` object (created by the parent class)
    # to send and receive data.
    #THESE ARE TAKEN FROM THE PARENT CLASS AND WE OVERRIED THEM HERE WITH ACTUAL IMPLEMENTATIONS
