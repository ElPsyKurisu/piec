This is an example of a driver instrument type, but there is no __init__.py file to ensure its not picked up as a valid module
The outline.md file contains the information needed to pass to an AI to create the drivers. Typically the newer methods are at the bottom of the file. Once stabilized it will be cleaned up
the example.py is an example of a filled out driver that the AI can use as an example to see how they should fill out the driver they are tasked with.
