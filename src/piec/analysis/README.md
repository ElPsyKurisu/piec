# Analysis
Modules containing various helper functions for use in data acquisition and analysis.

## Hysteresis
These are single waveform measurments typically consisting of a triangle wave field application.

## PUND
These are single waveform measurments typically consisting of a reset voltage pulse followed by two identical measurment pulses. The reset pulse is used to reset the device to a known state, while the measurement pulses are used to measure the device's response to the reset pulse. The response from the second measurment pulse is subtracted from the first to extract only displacement current in the circuit. This is a standard measurement technique used in ferroelectric devices.

## Utilities
