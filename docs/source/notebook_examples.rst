Jupyter Notebook Examples
=========================


``piec`` includes a collection of Jupyter notebooks designed to help you get started with the library, explore its features, and customize experiments. These notebooks offer more flexibility and customization options compared to the pre-built GUIs.

Accessing Notebooks
-------------------
The Jupyter notebooks are typically located in the ``notebooks/`` or ``src/piec/notebooks/`` directory of the ``piec`` repository. To run them:
1.  Ensure you have Jupyter Lab or Jupyter Notebook installed (`pip install jupyterlab`).
2.  Navigate to the directory containing the notebooks in your terminal.
3.  Launch Jupyter Lab: `jupyter lab`
4.  Open the desired ``.ipynb`` file from the Jupyter interface.

Available Notebooks
-------------------
(You might want to list a few key notebooks here with brief descriptions if they are central to the user experience, e.g., based on files like `elpsykurisu/piec/piec-537adb7afb32347bf4cd6e7583797f3d36bcf9b7/notebooks/FE_testing.ipynb`, `elpsykurisu/piec/piec-537adb7afb32347bf4cd6e7583797f3d36bcf9b7/notebooks/amr.ipynb` etc.)

* **Ferroelectric Testing (FE_testing.ipynb)**: Demonstrates hysteresis and PUND measurements.
* **Anisotropic Magnetoresistance (amr.ipynb)**: Example of setting up and running an AMR experiment.
* **Arduino Stepper Control (Arduino_Stepper_Example.ipynb)**: Shows how to interface with an Arduino for motor control.
* ... (add others as appropriate)

These notebooks provide practical examples of how to initialize instruments, configure measurements, run experiments, and analyze data using ``piec``.
